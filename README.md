A Terraform module for deploying FortiGate clusters on AWS with support for both FGCP (FortiGate Clustering Protocol) and FGSP (FortiGate Session Sync Protocol) clustering modes.

## Features

- üèóÔ∏è **Multiple Cluster Types**: Support for FGCP and FGSP clustering
- üåê **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Deploy across multiple Availability Zones for high availability
- üîß **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable instance types, licensing, and network settings
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Focused**: Built-in security groups and network segmentation
- üìä **Gateway Load Balancer**: Optional GWLB integration for advanced traffic distribution
- üè∑Ô∏è **Consistent Tagging**: Standardized resource tagging for better management

## Architecture

This module creates a complete FortiGate cluster infrastructure including:

- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- FortiGate instances configured in FGCP or FGSP mode
- Security groups with appropriate rules
- Network interfaces and routing
- Optional Gateway Load Balancer configuration
- IAM roles and policies for FortiGate operations

## Usage

### Basic FGCP Cluster (Single AZ)

```hcl
module "fortigate_cluster" {
  source = "github.com/jmvigueras/aws-fgt-cluster-module?ref=v1.0.0"

  prefix = "my-fgt-cluster"
  region = "us-west-2"
  azs    = ["us-west-2a"]

  fgt_number_peer_az = 2
  fgt_cluster_type   = "fgcp"
  
  license_type  = "byol"
  instance_type = "c6i.large"
  fgt_build     = "build2795"
  
  fgt_vpc_cidr = "10.10.0.0/24"
  
  public_subnet_names_extra  = ["bastion"]
  private_subnet_names_extra = ["tgw", "protected"]
}
```

### FGCP Cluster with High Availability (Multi-AZ)

```hcl
module "fortigate_cluster_ha" {
  source = "github.com/jmvigueras/aws-fgt-cluster-module?ref=v1.0.0"

  prefix = "my-fgt-ha"
  region = "us-west-2"
  azs    = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]

  fgt_number_peer_az = 1
  fgt_cluster_type   = "fgcp"
  
  license_type  = "payg"
  instance_type = "c6i.xlarge"
  fgt_build     = "build2795"
  
  fgt_vpc_cidr = "10.20.0.0/24"
}
```

### FGSP Cluster with Gateway Load Balancer

```hcl
module "fortigate_fgsp_gwlb" {
  source = "github.com/jmvigueras/aws-fgt-cluster-module?ref=v1.0.0"

  prefix = "my-fgt-fgsp"
  region = "us-west-2"
  azs    = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]

  fgt_number_peer_az = 1
  fgt_cluster_type   = "fgsp"
  
  license_type  = "byol"
  instance_type = "c6i.large"
  fgt_build     = "build2795"
  
  fgt_vpc_cidr = "10.30.0.0/23"
  config_gwlb  = true
}
```

## Cluster Types

### FGCP (FortiGate Clustering Protocol)
- **Members**: 2 FortiGates only
- **Deployment**: 1 or 2 Availability Zones
- **Use Case**: Active-Passive high availability
- **Sync**: Configuration and session synchronization

### FGSP (FortiGate Session Sync Protocol)
- **Members**: Up to 16 FortiGates (recommended: ‚â§8)
- **Deployment**: Multiple Availability Zones
- **Use Case**: Active-Active load balancing
- **Sync**: Session synchronization only

## Providers

| Name | Version |

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |

| azs | List of Availability Zones | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| fgt_cluster_type | Type of FortiGate cluster (fgcp/fgsp) | `string` | `"fgcp"` | no |
| fgt_number_peer_az | Number of FortiGates per AZ | `number` | `1` | no |
| instance_type | EC2 instance type for FortiGates | `string` | `"c6i.large"` | no |
| license_type | License type (byol/payg) | `string` | `"byol"` | no |

## Examples

See the [examples](./examples) directory for complete deployment scenarios:

- [FGCP Single AZ](./examples/fgcp-single-az)
- [FGCP Multi-AZ](./examples/fgcp-multi-az)
- [FGSP with GWLB](./examples/fgsp-gwlb)
- [Complete Infrastructure](./examples/complete)

## Security Considerations

- **Network Segmentation**: Separate public and private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive ingress/egress rules
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for FortiGate operations
- **Encryption**: EBS volumes encrypted by default
- **Access Control**: Management access through secure channels only

## Cost Optimization

- Choose appropriate instance types based on throughput requirements
- Consider PAYG vs BYOL licensing based on usage patterns
- Use Spot instances for non-production environments
- Implement proper tagging for cost allocation
